I am a PhD Student in the Harvard Biophysics program, with interests in neuroscience and cancer evolution.

I received by B.S. in Physics from the University of Notre Dame, where I worked with Zolt√°n Toroczkai on distance-based network models of brain connectivity. 

Outside of my alma maters, I received a Postbaccalaureate Intramural Research Training Award to work at the NIMH (2017-2018). I was a Janelia Undergraduate Scholar with Ann Hermundstad, collaborating with Vivek Jayaraman, on modeling fly behavior using Reinforcement Learning (2017). I participated in the Undergraduate Research Program at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, optimizing a calcium imaging analysis pipeline with Anne Churchland and Matt Kaufman (2016).
