I am pursuing a Ph.D. in the [Harvard Biophysics Graduate Program](https://biophysics.fas.harvard.edu/), researching neuroscience and cancer (2018-TBD). 

I received my B.S. in [Physics](https://physics.nd.edu/) from the University of Notre Dame, where I worked with [Zolt√°n Toroczkai](http://obelix.phys.nd.edu/) on distance-based network models of brain connectivity (2013-2017)

Previously, I worked on a [Postbaccalaureate Intramural Research Training Award](https://www.training.nih.gov/programs/postbac_irta) at the [National Institute of Mental Health](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/index.shtml) (2017-2018). As a [Janelia Undergraduate Scholar](https://www.janelia.org/you-janelia/students-postdocs/undergraduate-scholars-program), I modeled fly behavior using Reinforcement Learning with [Ann Hermundstad](https://www.janelia.org/lab/hermundstad-lab) and [Vivek Jayaraman](https://www.janelia.org/lab/jayaraman-lab) (2017). I participated in the [Undergraduate Research Program](https://www.cshl.edu/education/undergraduate-research-program/) at [Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory](https://www.cshl.edu/), optimizing a calcium imaging analysis pipeline with [Anne Churchland](http://churchlandlab.labsites.cshl.edu/) and [Matt Kaufman](https://sites.google.com/site/antimatt/) (2016). At MIT, I prototyped methods for reconstructing neurons from Expansion Microscopy with [Adam Marblestone](http://web.mit.edu/amarbles/www/index.html) and [Ed Boyden](http://syntheticneurobiology.org/) (2015). Even earlier, I assisted with Yeast-Two Hybrid assays of protein-protein interactions with [Nidhi Sahni](https://faculty.mdanderson.org/profiles/nidhi_sahni.html) in [Marc Vidal](https://www.dfhcc.harvard.edu/insider/member-detail/member/marc-vidal-phd/)'s [Center for Cancer Systems Biology](https://ccsb.dana-farber.org/) at the [Dana Farber Cancer Institute](https://www.dana-farber.org/) (2012), and developed face recognition software for social interaction research with [Manuel Cebrian](https://www.media.mit.edu/people/cebrian/overview/) in [Sandy Pentland](https://www.media.mit.edu/people/sandy/overview/)'s [Human Dynamics](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/human-dynamics/overview/) group at the [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/) (2010).
