I am a PhD Student in the Harvard Biophysics program, researching neuroscience and cancer (2018-TBD). 

I received by B.S. in Physics from the University of Notre Dame, where I worked with Zolt√°n Toroczkai on distance-based network models of brain connectivity (2013-2017)

Previously, I received a [Postbaccalaureate Intramural Research Training Award ](https://www.training.nih.gov/programs/postbac_irta) to work at the [National Institute of Mental Health](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/index.shtml) (2017-2018). As a [Janelia Undergraduate Scholar](https://www.janelia.org/you-janelia/students-postdocs/undergraduate-scholars-program), I modeled fly behavior using Reinforcement Learning with [Ann Hermundstad](https://www.janelia.org/lab/hermundstad-lab) and [Vivek Jayaraman](https://www.janelia.org/lab/jayaraman-lab) (2017). I participated in the Undergraduate Research Program at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, optimizing a calcium imaging analysis pipeline with Anne Churchland and Matt Kaufman (2016). At MIT, I prototyped methods for reconstructing neurons from Expansion Microscopy with Adam Marblestone and Ed Boyden (2015). Even earlier, I assisted with Yeast-Two Hybrid assays of protein-protein interactions with Nidhi Sanhi in Marc Vidal's CCSB at DFCI (2012), and developed face recognition software for social interaction research with Manuel Cebrian in Sandy Pentland's Human Dynamics group at the MIT Media Lab (2010).
